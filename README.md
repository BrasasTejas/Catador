# The Catador's Roll

Catador: A professional cigar taster who determines a cigar's qualities of taste, texture, and aroma. [source](https://www.thompsoncigar.com/infotemplate/CigarGlossary)

## Steps

In the project directory, we attempt to hand-roll you, the Catador, the finest cigar:
1. npm run eject
   - not sure if this will end up being a good idea later when wanting to utilize [React-Materialize](https://react-materialize.github.io/#/)
2. removed all styling from components aside from the global styling available in [index.css]
3. using [App.js] as root element vs. [Index.js] for layout to accomodate for future development
4. added [NPM prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
